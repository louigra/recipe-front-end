                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    I created this website as a project to learn how to use HTML and set up my own website, database, and security.<br><br>
                    I am also using this website to keep track of the recipes that I like, in their final form after I am done experimenting.<br>

                <p>
                    I follow a process that can be best described as <em>"not a process"</em>, or <em>"winging it"</em>  when I cook. 
                    Below is a generalized step by step process that you should feel free to ignore.<br><br>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Decide there is something I would like to cook</li>
                    <li>Google it and pick the first recipe with a picture I like</li>
                    <li>Read most of the recipe once, look at the ingredient list and get what I deem <strong>Absolutely Necessary</strong></li>
                    <li>Do about 50% of the cooking, then look at the recipe again</li>
                    <li>Eat my creation, and decide what changes should be made next time to make it better</li>
                    <li>Forget to write it down</li>
                </ol>
